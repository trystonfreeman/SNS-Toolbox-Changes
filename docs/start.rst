Installation Instructions
=========================

SNS-Toolbox can be installed using pip:
::
    pip install sns-toolbox

The package can also be built locally. To do so, clone the repository from `github <https://github.com/wnourse05/SNS-Toolbox>`_, navigate to the root directory, and run the following command:
::
    pip install -e

So far this has been tested using Python 3.8, which is also the newest version that pytorch (torch) is fully compatible with.

Pytorch may need to be installed separately from the other packages in pip, since which configuration of torch you install is dependent on your personal system configuration. For instructions on installing torch, please see their `documentation <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>`_.
